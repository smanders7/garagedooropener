ArduinoAES256

A small test/demo project based on "A byte-oriented AES-256 implementation" by Ilya
http://www.literatecode.com/2007/11/11/aes256/
This is implementation of his code tested on an Arduino Duemilanove

===== smanders integration for RaspberryPi =========

Here I just created a main.cpp file that creates a command line interface into the
aes256 code.  I'm not sure this code is 100% aes compliant but I was able to get
it working.  This works in conjuction with the Arduino and the iPhone App that
opens/checks status of your garagedoor.

Build:
To create your aes256_decrypt executable
Run "make"

Install:
To install just really just copies the aes256_decrypt to the
php_code dir.
Run "make install"
